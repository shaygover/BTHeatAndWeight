For game v1.9

Add two levels of heatsinks, weight loss plates and targeting enhancers to the game. 

Two levels are offered: 
1. lvl1: Reversed engineered SLDF grade items. Available from the start. Good for adding a weapon or two at max, a few points of armor or heatsinks.
2. lvl2: Better items, SLDF grade. Available on lvl4 and lvl5 in SLDFItemsInShops.
